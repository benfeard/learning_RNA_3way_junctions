# learning_RNA_3way_junctions
 
The goal of this project is to write a Python script that uses machine learning to take in RNA sequences and base pairing data for three-way junctions to try and predict the alignment of the stems A, B, and C.

The input would be an RNA sequence and the base pair information. The features would be the sequence of stems A, B, C and the sequence of the junctions connecting the stems, X, Y, Z.

I will need to generate a training set by hand as most online databases aren't create to specifically provide information on specific features such as RNA 3-way junctions.

The training set will be small so this will be an exercise in machine learning algorithms rather than a conclusive study.
